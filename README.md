All of our work (including data preprocessing, training models, analyzing weights, and making visualizations) are in the ml4va.ipynb notebook. The "other" folder has intermediate work on preprocessing and training models. Please only refer to our final ml4va.ipynb. You will also have to download the data from the link above and change the pd.read_csv line to read from the right file location.
